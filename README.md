```
If you have no idea what is docker, i have bad news for you, bro 2k19 come on! You should now all of this stuff.

Run: 
```
source .env
```

You can change the host name by editing the .env file.

If you modify the host server name, do not forget to add it to the /etc/hosts file.

All of docker variables you can find at .env file.
